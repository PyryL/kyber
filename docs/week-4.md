# Week 4

_20. â€“ 26.11.2023_

This week I started implementing own data structures. First, I added `PolynomialRing` which, as the name tells, represents polynomial ring structure and handles its core calculations. My original plan was also to implement matrix structure, but it turned out to be much slower than Numpy array, and therefore will not be added. I also added more unit tests and started adding performance tests.

Total working time: 5 hours
