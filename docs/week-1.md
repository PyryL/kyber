# Week 1

_30.10. - 5.11.2023_

* **Saturday 28.10.** Studied the core mathematical operations of Kyber **2h**
* **Monday 30.10.** Started this course and familiarized myself with its tasks and objectives. **1h**
* **Tuesday 2.11.** Met with supervisor Hannu Kärnä on Zoom and made the final decision about project topic. **1h**
* **Friday 3.11.** Wrote [requirements specification](requirements.md) document and studied Kyber specification document (linked as a reference in requirements specification) **2h**
* **Saturday 4.11.** Finished requirements specification document and read more about Kyber specification **2h**

I think (and hope) that I have gained basic knowledge about how Kyber works. I have also built a coarse plan of how I will start implementing it. Next week I will be wiser about how difficult the implementation will really be for me.
