# Week 5

_27.11. â€“ 3.12.2023_

This week I improved and added unit tests to lift branch coverage back to 100% (from 99% last week). I also added new performance tests. Documentation went through a process where I improved explanation and added the last missing one, implementation document. Finally, I had some time to response some of the issues that the first peer review pointed out.

Total working time: 5 hours
