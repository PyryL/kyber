# Week 3

_13. â€“ 19.11.2023_

This week I continued where I left off last week. First, I implemented encoding in a way that the outputs of all relevant functions are bytes (instead of polynomial matrices, for example). Then I implemented CPAPKE section of the official specification document which is the part that makes Kyber key-encapsulation mechanism and not asymmetric encryption algorithm. I have kept constantly adding more tests to keep the coverage at 100% and pylint score has also been steady at around 9.2.

Next week I will start implementing my own data structures. The first will be polynomial ring, to which I should specify at least multiplication and addition operations.

Total working time this week: 7.5 hours.
